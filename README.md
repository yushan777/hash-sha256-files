The hash-sha256-files.sh script calculates the SHA-256 checksum for files in a specified directory, excluding certain types of files. It outputs the results to the terminal and saves them to a file named checksums.txt.

Usage
Save the script as hash-sha256-files.sh.
Make it executable:
```
chmod +x hash-sha256-files.sh
```

Run the script, passing the target directory as an argument:
```
./hash-sha256-files.sh /path/to/directory
```
